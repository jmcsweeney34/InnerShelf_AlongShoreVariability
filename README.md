# InnerShelf_AlongShoreVariability
A subproject of the Inner Shelf DRI (https://scripps.ucsd.edu/projects/innershelf/) that focuses on alongshore variability of internal tidal properties    

This analysis was written in matlab for my postdoc;  As a side project, I've been slowly rewriting it into python.  This repository is a blend of the matlab and python codes, with readme files to describe the progress.
